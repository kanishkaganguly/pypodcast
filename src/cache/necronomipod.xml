      <title>Herbert Baumeister</title>
      <description>Grab a beer and join us tonight as we cover Herbert Baumeister! While he was raised in a seemingly normal family home, early on, Herb started exhibiting behaviors that appalled not just his schoolmates, but even his own parents. After mental health concerns went untreated, Herb continued on with his life, eventually marrying and having a family of his own. His odd behaviors, however, would continue, until finally his son found skeletal remains on the family farm, leading to a police investigation. And the discovery that Herb Baumeister was, in fact, a serial killer.

      <title>Jeffrey Epstein Part 3</title>
      <description>Grab a beer and join us tonight as we continue our series on Jeffrey Epstein! In part three we will cover the investigation into Epstein by Police Chief Michael Reiter and Detective Joe Recarey, who wouldn't back down from Epstein's wealth and power. We will cover aspects of the probable cause affidavit to show how far these sexual assaults went, and what the search of his Palm Beach mansion revealed to police. Finally we'll show how none of that really matters when you're a billionaire with powerful connections.

      <description>Grab a beer and join us tonight as we start our series on Andrei Chikatilo! In part one we will cover Chikatilo's childhood during the Ukrainian famine under communist Soviet Union, and his early troubles with women. The troubles with romantic relationships would turn into a hatred of women, and then into the realization that violent acts would be his only way of sexual gratification.

      <title>History of Exorcisms</title>
      <description>Grab a beer and join us tonight as we discuss the history of exorcisms! We will go over how far back exorcisms go in history, as well as the religions that have exorcisms - and how they carry them out. We also take a deep dive into the Catholic church's version of exorcisms, and go over three separate cases.

      <title>Scientology Part 1</title>
      <description>Grab a beer and join us tonight, as we start our series on Scientology! In part one we will discuss the life of their founder L. Ron Hubbard. We use Scientology's version of Hubbard's biography, and Russel Miller's book Bare Faced Messiah to get to the bottom of what is fact and what is fiction about his early life. We will also touch on Hubbard's path crossing with Aleister Crowley, and his writings that would become Dianetics.

      <title>Children of God Part 2</title>
      <description>Grab a beer and join us tonight as we wrap up our series on The Children of God! We'll get into the most infamous aspect of the cult - flirty fishing. David Berg implemented religious prostitution that would grow the cult's numbers to new heights - and spiral the cult into depraved acts of pedophilia. We'll also take a look at what could be the most disturbing cult artifact left behind - The Story of Davidito. All of these criminal acts would fall on the cult's messiah Ricky Rodriguez AKA Daviditio. This abuse would have very real, and lasting consequences - as Ricky's need for revenge would grow to a boiling point.

      <description>Grab a beer and join us tonight as we discuss the alien manifesto of Kyle Odom! We go into the details of his 2016 shooting of Pastor Tim Remington, through Kyle Odom being arrested outside the White House in Washington DC. Kyle left behind a manifesto, which could be the most detailed look into the spiraling mind of someone suffering from schizophrenia. We go over his manifesto page by page, and see how a once 30 year old man working to complete his PhD came to believe aliens were attempting to ruin his life.
