      <itunes:subtitle>This week, we continue our five-part series on the Black Death. In Part Three, we take a closer look at the Catholic Church&apos;s system of selling indulgences; we learn how one horny pope moved the papacy to Avignon; we examine the virulent antisemitism that engulfed so much of plague-stricken Europe; and we recount the tale of the curse of Grand Master de Molay.
